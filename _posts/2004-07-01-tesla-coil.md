I build this tesla coil as a hobby project while in college.  This device is a high-voltage resonant transformer like a traditional Tesla
coil. However, it has a solid-state driver that I designed to drive the coil at its resonantant frequency (230kHz). The picture above shows a typical high voltage discharge. I am currently developing a more efficient resonant driver with an audio input to modulate the .
