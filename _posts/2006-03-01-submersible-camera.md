In college, my friends and I made a trip to Isle de Culbra in Puerto Rico. At the time, underwater camera cases were unaffordable with my student budget or unavailable so I built a sealed camera case out of pieces of acrylic that I found around the lab. To operate the camera I made two mechanical feed throughs out of plastic rods, steel tubing, and surgical tubing.

With my camera, we were able to lot of pictures of the reefs and the Puerto Rican sea life.
