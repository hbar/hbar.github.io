<p> While at the Synchrotron Lab for part of winter vacation in 2004, I designed and
built most of the hardware and circuitry for this system. I installed it to inspect
the position of the x-ray beams in the G-line x-ray diffraction facility.</p>


<p> It uses electronically actuated pneumatic valves and pistons to move phosphorous
screens into the two beams. The x-rays illuminate the screens which are viewed by
two CCD cameras.</p>

The system worked very nicely, allowing an operator to remotely insert and remove
the screens, and visually monitor the beam position with the cameras.
