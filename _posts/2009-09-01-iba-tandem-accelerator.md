For my masters research I built an accelerator facility to perform ion beam analysis (IBA) on plasma facing materials from fusion reactors.  The accelerator was built from a decommissioned and disassembled 1.7 megavolt tandem accelerator that was donated to the lab.  This accelerator construction and upgrade project was collaboration done in collaboration with P.W. Stahle and D.G.Whyte and took about 3 years.  The result was a fully functional linear accelerator user facility for materials research for fusion reactors.

After completion the accelorator construction, I devolped a beamline that proced external ion beams (the beam passes a 7micron vacuum tight foil into the air) that is use to study large reactor components in air that would otherwise fit in an evacuated target chamber.

Using this accerlator and the external IBA setup, I was able to analyze plasma facing components that removed from the reactor to study erosion and deposition patterns of materials such tungsten caused by the high temperature plasma inside of fusion devices.
