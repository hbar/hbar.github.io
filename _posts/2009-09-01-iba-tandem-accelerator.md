For my masters research I built an accelerator facility to perform ion beam analysis (IBA) on plasma facing materials from fusion reactors.  The accelerator was built from a decommissioned and disassembled 1.7 megavolt tandem accelerator that was donated to the lab.

IBA is used to analyze plasma facing components that removed from the reactor to study erosion and deposition patters caused by the high temperature plasma.
