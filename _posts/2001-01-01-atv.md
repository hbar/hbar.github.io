![ATV](/images/atv.jpg){: .inline-img}

I designed this vehicle during junior year of high school, and built it out of
steel and a few standard go-kart parts. It was designed mainly for off road with its large ATV tires and full suspension, but I also optimized the steering linkages so the front wheels would properly track even in tight turns to improve on-road road performance.

This vehicle has a unique full-suspension design and has independently-controlled disc brakes on
both sides of the rear differential. With its 8hp engine and torque converter,
this vehicle performed well in mud, in snow, and on dirt roads.
