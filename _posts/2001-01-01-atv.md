I designed this vehicle during junior year of high school, and built it out of
steel and a few standard go-kart parts. I engineered it to handle well in
off-road conditions. But, I also designed for its on-road handling by optimizing
the steering linkages so the front wheel planes would rotate a slightly different
amount to account for the difference in the inner and outer turning radii. It has
a unique full-suspension design and has independently-controlled disc brakes on
both sides of the rear differential. With its 8hp engine and torque converter,
this vehicle performed beautifully off road, in the snow and all other conditions
that I exposed it to.
