While working with pulsed-power accelerators at Sandia National Labs, I decided
to create my own pulsed-power device in my apartment. It works by sequentially discharging
capacitors through solenoids to create magnetic field pulses. Each
capacitor is discharged by a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR), each of which is
triggered by optical sensors that detect the projectile as it moves through the
barrel. It is currently configured to operate with magnetic iron projectiles (each ~1 gram).
Its timing can also be reconfigured to inductively accelerate aluminum projectiles.
