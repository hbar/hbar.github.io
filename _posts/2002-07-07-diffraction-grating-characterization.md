Before my first year at Cornell, during the summer of 2002, I worked at Albany
NanoTech testing micro-fabricated diffraction gratings. These were patterned
glass transmission gratings, periodic in 2 dimensions.

There was a need to design unique diffraction gratings with specific properties,
so I wrote software to numerically simulate the diffraction patterns with purely
geometric techniques. The program can simulate any arbitrary grating with a laser
at any angle of incidence.
