<p>I designed and built this tokamak at home during fall 2005. Most of the physical
construction is complete. It has a major radius of 1.5 inches. The design parameters
were optimized a much as possible but were limited materials that I could obtain obtain at the time.</p>

<p>I am now in the process of designing a new numerically modeling hte magnetic fields and designing the
power supplies. I also plan to evenually experiment with RF heating. Based on calculations
I expect that if I pulse coils of the tokamak with the capacitors I have available, I can
produce a magnetically confined plasma with a peak toroidal field of ~0.005 Tesla.</p>
