I designed this sailboat and built it at home during my 2nd and 3rd years of high
school. The hull is made out of plywood, pine boards, fiberglass, and epoxy. The
rigging is made from rope, steel cable, and a really straight, hand-carved maple
tree. I went out in the woods to find a maple tree of the right size, cut it down
and dragged it about half a mile through the woods. The boat was made with a chisel
I made and sharpened, then used to carve out the mast for the sail. The sail was
purchased.

Overall, the boat sailed quite nicely.
