For my doctoral research I developed a novel in-situ ion-accelerator-based diagnostic technique for
studying plasma-materials interactions in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak at MIT.

This is the first diagnostic to provide in-situ, spatially-resolved measurements of the effects
of plasma-materials interactions in a fusion reactor. This has important implications for magnetic
fusion energy science.

Through this project, I also developed a strong background in accelerator engineering and particle
beam modeling. I rebuilt and upgraded a radio frequency quadrupole accelerator, including its control
and power systems. In addition, I developed my own ion beam dynamics simulation tools for modelin
ion beams in the complex fields of a tokamak.
