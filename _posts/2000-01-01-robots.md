Robots 1 and 2 are both insect-like robots that use servo motors controlled
by pulse-width-modulated signals from a BASIC stamp II microprocessor that
makes decisions based on input from various sensors. I built them from scratch
in my basement during my 2nd and 3rd years of high school for two science-fair
projects. Robot 1 worked very nicely, it could walk, turn, respond to light and
and map its environment. It won 4th place in ISEF (Intel International Science
and Engineering Fair).

Robot 2 was much more advanced but half the size (7" long). It had all the same
capabilities as the previous robot, but I also developed an infrared ranging
system, directional light sensors, a more optimal articulation geometry, and
mechanisms for climbing. So, in principle, it can do everything a live insect can
do, except reproduce --

It can smoothly articulate to move and climb, it can see with IR, feel with touch
sensors, and can find light and charge its batteries with solar panels, thus
feeding itself.

Robot 3 is still under construction. When completed, it should have all of Robot
2's capabilities except it's a sixth the size. I am also planning on adding an
RF transmitter/receiver ICs, so it can communicate with a computer or other robots.
