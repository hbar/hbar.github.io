While working with pulsed power accelerators at Sandia National Labs, I decided
to create my own accelerator in my apartment. It works by sequentially discharging
capacitors through these solenoids to create very strong B field pulses. Each
capacitor is discharged by a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR), each of which is
triggered by optical sensors that detect the projectile as it moves through the
barrel.

It is currently configured to operate with magnetic iron projectiles (each ~1 gram).
Its timing can also be reconfigured to inductively accelerate aluminum projectiles.
I haven't yet tested it at its maximum energy (~1000 J), but in preliminary tests
with 1/32nd of its maximum energy, I was able to launch a 1g projectile about 20 feet.
Calculations show that at maximum energy (assuming 1% efficiency), it should be able
to accelerate a 1g projectile to ~140 m/s.
