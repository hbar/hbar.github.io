Like every other self-respecting mad scientist out there, I had to build myself
a Tesla coil. I ended up designing a solid-state driver for this, however.

This device is a high-voltage resonant transformer, like the traditional Tesla
coil. However, it has a solid-state half-bridge driver that I designed, which
operates in the 100-800kHz range.

The picture above shows a typical HV discharge. I am currently developing a more
efficient resonant driver, so I can achieve considerably higher voltages.
