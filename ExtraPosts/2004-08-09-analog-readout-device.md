I designed, built, and tested this device in about 2 weeks during the summer
of 2004. Some of the parts of hte X-ray optics at the Cornell High Energy
Synchrotron Source (CHESS) are connected to linear potentiometers to measure
their position.

This device very accurately measures the singals from 4 potentiometers (or
any other analog devices), and displays the signal digitally. Each channelh has
an adjustable zero position and an adjustable gain control, and has an analog
output that can be connected to an ADC in a computer.
